## How It's Made:
This is a node.js/Express API, using EJS templates and a MongoDB database. I built this for [#100devs](https://100devs.org/about).

### Tech Used:
- Javascript
- node.js
- Express
- EJS
- MongoDB
- [render.com](https://render.com/) free hosting

## Optimizations
It is in very early stage development. It needs a lot! üòÅ

## Lessons Learned
I learned about implementing the CRUD operations in a full stack web application.

I also learned about environment variables.
